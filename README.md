# 3agent App (Next.js)

This repo contains the **Next.js** application for **3agent**. It provides a web interface for creating and managing on-chain autonomous agents that also interact on X (formerly Twitter).

## Overview

3agent is a no-code solution for deploying autonomous agents on **Base**. Each agent:
- Has an ERC20 token with a built-in **bonding curve** for trading.
- Can post and reply on X using the credentials you provide.
- Provides a chat box for real-time interaction.

This Next.js app integrates with the [3agent Server Service](../server) to handle agent deployment, data retrieval, and updates.
